# Compi.-Lexical-Syntactic

## Getting Started
To use this files in the IDE-Triangle you have to compress a .zip file with the next folders:
* TAM folder with all its subdirectories.
* Triangle folder with all its subdirectories.
* META-INF folder containing a file named MANIFEST.MF

The content of the MANIFEST.MF file can be simple text, with the next lines:
```
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: 0.92-gcc
```

When the .zip file has been generated the extension name must be changed to .jar, calling it Triangle.jar.

To execute the IDE-Triangle, you must have the files IDE.Triangle.jar and Triangle.jar in the same directory.
